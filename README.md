# Ames Housing Data Analysis and Prediction

This project leverages the Ames Housing dataset to explore and predict housing prices based on various features. The analysis follows a structured data science workflow, incorporating data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation. Below is a summary of the key steps performed in this notebook.

## Objectives
- Understand the Ames Housing dataset and its structure.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and relationships.
- Preprocess and clean the data for modeling.
- Engineer relevant features to enhance predictive performance.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models for housing price prediction.

## Key Steps

### 1. Data Exploration
- **Dataset Overview:** Loaded and inspected the Ames Housing dataset.
